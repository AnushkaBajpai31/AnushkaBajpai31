## 🎯 Featured Projects

### 📦 Mini Data Warehouse + Query Engine
Columnar mini data warehouse with a custom SQL-like query engine supporting joins, aggregates, partition pruning, predicate pushdown, and vectorized execution.  
**Tech:** Python, Go, FastAPI, SQLite, Docker

### 🌊 Real-Time Streaming Data Platform
Distributed log-based streaming system with partitioned topics, consumer groups, at-least-once delivery semantics, offset management, and fault recovery.  
**Tech:** Go, gRPC, RocksDB, Docker, Prometheus

### 📊 Hybrid Vector & Metadata Search Engine
- ⁠Architected and benchmarked a hybrid search system to solve the "selective filtering" problem in vector databases, comparing Pre-filtering, Post-filtering, and Metadata-aware Inverted File (IVF) structures.
- Implemented a Custom Metadata IVF Index that routed queries to relevant partitions, achieving a ~77x speedup (0.23ms vs. 17.9ms) over standard Post-filtering for highly selective queries (0.4% selectivity).
- ⁠Optimized query execution using Bitmap-based filtering, which proved most efficient for "Very Loose" selectivity (100% match), outperforming partition-based routing by approximately 35%.
- ⁠Conducted rigorous performance analysis across three selectivity regimes—Very Selective (0.4%), Loose (17.7%), and Very Loose (100%)—to identify the optimal cross-over points for hybrid search strategies.
- ⁠Engineered baselines using IVFPQ and IVF-Flat indices on a 100,000-row dataset of 768-dimensional embeddings, analyzing the trade-offs between brute-force pre-filtering and ANN-based post-filtering.

**Tech:** Python, FAISS, NumPy, Pandas, Bitmaps, arXiv Dataset (100k records)

### 🛒 Agentic Shopping Assistant with Hybrid RAG
- Architected an end-to-end Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to assist users in discovering and purchasing products from a 2,000-item Amazon dataset.
- Engineered a Hybrid Search Engine by integrating dense vector retrieval (FAISS) with sparse keyword matching (BM25), enabling accurate handling of both semantic queries (e.g., "casual games") and exact product matches.
- Developed a Multi-Tool Agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK, incorporating a customized search_products tool for agentic retrieval and a purchase_product tool that interfaces with a mock transaction API.
- Implemented Advanced Prompt Engineering with custom system instructions to enforce strict metadata-aware filtering (e.g., price constraints), achieving a 100% pass rate across a rigorous 10-case evaluation suite.
- Optimized agent behavior through Deterministic Selection Logic, enabling the assistant to autonomously identify and prioritize products based on user-defined constraints like price, numeric ratings, and review counts.
- Integrated Automated Evaluation workflows to score agent performance based on tool-calling accuracy, multi-step sequencing, and the ability to maintain professional boundaries for out-of-scope requests.
 
Tech Stack: Python, LangChain, FAISS, BM25, OpenAI Agents SDK, Hugging Face Embeddings, Pandas, JSON.

### 🎮 AI-Based Connect 4 Game Service
Full stack game service with RESTful APIs in FastAPI for session management and persistent game state, paired with an AI bot using alpha-beta pruning with iterative deepening.  
**Tech:** Python, FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redux

## Other Projects

### 🧠 Transformer Language Model from Scratch

- Built the **full training pipeline** from scratch: memory-mapped data loading, batching, AdamW optimization, gradient clipping, checkpointing, and cosine learning rate scheduling.
- Trained a ~**17M parameter model** on the **TinyStories** dataset, achieving **≤ 1.8 validation loss**, with further improvements at higher token budgets.
- Implemented **autoregressive decoding** with temperature scaling and **top-p (nucleus) sampling** for text generation.

### 🤖 Prison Dodgeball — Autonomous Game AI System
- Designed and implemented a physics-constrained ballistic interception system for autonomous agents, solving one-shot projectile trajectories against moving targets under gravity.
- Applied iterative numerical refinement to reconcile analytical intercept solutions with real-world constraints (speed limits, animation delay, dynamic launch points).
- Built decision heuristics combining kinematic stability analysis, navmesh path prediction, and parabolic occlusion checks to maximize hit probability while avoiding unrealistic throws.
- Integrated projectile prediction into a finite state machine–driven agent architecture, coordinating movement, evasion, ball collection, rescues, and throw timing.
- Balanced realism vs. accuracy tradeoffs common in production games by selectively rejecting infeasible or low-confidence actions.

**Tech:** Unity, C#, AI, Game AI
